# The bee's are particularly busy this time of year...

The little critters are often too busy to notice the comings and goings of their keepers. Especially when completed at the right time -- before 2nd Breakfast. Well then it's hardly a chore what with them off tending to the blooming mouse-leaf.

# At this rate the harvest was shaping up to be the bees knees...

The men of Upper Vales would often travel a day's journey, crossing the Great River by way of the North Bridge. All for one of their best delicacies -- Honey Ale. Rumor is the expert Woodsmen are unwilling to use the sturdier Dwarvish Bridge to the South. Something about their crafts being unwelcome in those parts. Why even the nearby Greenwood Elves have been known to drop by on their way to Dimrill Dale. Though the Elves have never been willing to share what they use the honey for. They always look amused and say quite plainly they'll eat it -- several barrel's that is.

_-- Somewhere in the Vale, where the bee's are blissfully unaware of the adventure this day will bring._
